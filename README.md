Hello and welcone to the repo of Language Distancing NLP project :)
This repo has been created by Anat Samohi and Daniel Weisberg Mitelman.
We would like to thank huggingface for their work that has been done!

## What should we prepare before using that code?
1. Clone the following: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers.git
2. Go to the directory transformers/examples/token-classification
3. Add the relevant code that we have added in this repo
4. Run the file run_pos_part_train.sh
5. With the results, you can use our plotting file or printing flies

#### May the odds be ever in your favor! ;)
